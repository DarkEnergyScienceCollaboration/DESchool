Pre-lesson homework and in-class exercise for Mike Jarvis' DE School lesson:

Clone the LSSTDESC/Coord repository onto your laptop.  The command to do so is
git clone git@github.com:LSSTDESC/Coord.git

If that doesn't work, you might need to tell GitHub your SSH key. See instructions here. If you can't figure that out, you can also use https instead, which I think works without the SSH key on file:

git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Coord.git

Try to install the code.  For most of you, this will simply involve running either
python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

or

sudo python setup.py install

depending on your setup and preferences.  However, if your system does not already have libffi installed, you may need to do a little bit more work to get this installed.  See the instructions here if necessary.

Make sure you have nose and astropy installed.
pip install nose astropy

Run the existing test suite, such as it is.
cd tests
nosetests

Make sure that you are a member of the LSSTDESC GitHub team.  I think everyone who is a DESC member is automatically signed up, but if you are not, then I think your best bet is to post on the #desc-ci Slack channel that you want to be added.  (The LSSTDESC GitHub owners all haunt that particular hallway.)
(Optional) Maybe take a look at the Coord documentation.  During the class I'll be asking you to design some tests for this package, so if you have a chance to familiarize yourself a little bit with the module, then you'll have a head start on Monday.
